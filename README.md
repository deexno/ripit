So, important points ahead: 

1. I am not a professional programmer and the code was written quick and dirty, maybe I will improve the code a bit in the future but currently it does what it is supposed to do.
2. I have not been writing and dealing with malware for very long, so I am sorry if I am wrong on some points, please feel free to clarify any incorrect statements, I am open to anything.
3. I am not responsible for any damage!
4. The malware was developed just for the joy of programming and is not intended for script kiddies to do any damage to IT-Systems!

# What can the malware encrypt
- Without administrator rights: Everything the user has read and write access to (network shares, his entire user directory and a few other things like external hard drives or USB).
- With administrator rights: The whole system as well as other things mentioned above (except data concerning the antivirus, which I excluded in a slightly different version).
